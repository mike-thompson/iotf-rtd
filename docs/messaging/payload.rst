Message Payload
===============

The Foundation supports sending and recieving messages in any format,
however we recommend the use of JSON and the IOTF event format
specification.


----


IOTF JSON Payload Specification
-------------------------------

It is simple to create a JSON message that meets the IOTF specification.

* The message must be a valid JSON object (not an array) with only two top level
  elements: **d** and **ts**
* The message must be UTF-8 encoded

Data
~~~~
The **d** element is where you include all data for the event (or
command) being transmitted in the message. 

* This element is required for your message to meet the IOTF message specification.
* This must always be a JSON object (not an array)
* In the case where you wish to send no data the **d** element should 
  still be present, but contain an empty object.

Example 1 - Simple Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: json

    {
      "d": {"msg": "Hello World"}
    }

Example 2 - Complex data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: json

    {
      "d": {
        "host": "IBM700-R9E683D", 
        "mem": 54.9, 
        "network": {
          "up": 1.22, 
          "down": 0.55
        },
        "cpu": 1.3, 
      }
    }

Example 3 - No data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: json

    {
      "d": {}
    }

Timestamp
~~~~~~~~~

The **ts** element allows you to associate a timestamp with the event
(or command). This is an optional element and if included its value should
be a valid ISO8601 encoded timestamp string.

.. code:: json

    {
      "d": {
        "host": "IBM700-R9E683D", 
        "mem": 54.9, 
        "network": {
          "up": 1.22, 
          "down": 0.55
        },
        "cpu": 1.3, 
      },
      "ts": "2014-12-30T14:47:36+00:00"
    }

Custom JSON payloads
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The IOT Foundation is designed to be open. You may send your event and command data in any 
format you choose, however if you choose to send data in a custom format it will limit some 
features of the service which can only function with a known payload format.

Below are a number of example payloads that are close the to the IOTF specification, but 
do not quite match it.  Each would be treated as a custom JSON payload:

**Example 1**

Root node is a JSON array

.. code:: json

  [
    {
      "d": {
        "myName": "Stuart's Pi",
        "cputemp": 46,
        "sine": -10,
        "cpuload": 1.45
      }
    },
    {
      "d": {
        "myName": "Stuart's Pi",
        "cputemp": 46,
        "sine": -10,
        "cpuload": 1.45
      }
    }
  ]


**Example 2**

"d" node is a JSON array

.. code:: json

  {
    "d": ["green", "yellow"]
  }


**Example 3**

Unexpected node at root level

.. code:: json

  {
    "d": {},
    "temp": 60,
    "ts": "2014-12-30T14:47:36+00:00"
  }
